Fares include all applicable taxes, fees and other charges imposed by any government or other authority. At the time of booking, passengers will be advised of such taxes, fees and charges included in the fare, which may be based on estimates. If following booking any new tax, fee or charge is imposed, or if such amounts increase between booking and the date of flight, passengers will not be charged such additional amounts, but will also not receive any refund in the event these amounts decrease.</p><p>Fares are only payable in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise agreed by Aero at the time of booking.</p></div></div></div><div class="FeatureDescription_container__ksXpW"><div class="FeatureDescription_title-container__WITfP"><div color="darkPrimary" class="sc-f22b6d8a-0 gyaJWu">3. Checked Baggage</div></div><div class="FeatureDescription_content-container__M8WFh"><div class="FeatureDescription_paragraph__agpON"><p>Each passenger may check two (2) bags weighing up to 50lb (23kg) at no additional cost.  If space allows, passengers may check additional pieces of baggage for a price of $150 per bag, which can be paid via our Concierge before the day of the flight or in the lounge before you board. Please contact our Concierge (concierge@aero.com) to confirm availability for additional baggage prior to arrival at the airport.</p><p>Mobility and assistive devices which cannot be carried in the cabin due to space limitations will be considered checked baggage in addition to the included baggage allowance, without charge, provided the passenger is dependent upon such items.  Mobility aids are assigned the highest boarding priority and every reasonable effort will be made to transport passengers and their mobility aids on the same flight.  There may be times, however, when space, weight and safe stowage constraints may limit the number of devices which may physically and safely fit onto a particular aircraft.  For example, most non-collapsible mobility aids powered by dry and wet cell batteries are too large to fit onboard the aircraft.  When this happens, we will coordinate with the passenger and endeavor to offer the best solution available.</p><p>Carrier’s liability for lost or damaged luggage is limited as follows:</p><p>●  	For INTERNATIONAL flights, pursuant to the Montreal Convention, Carrier’s liability for lost or damaged checked baggage is limited to the actual value of the baggage but not more than 1,288 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) (approximately $1,800) per passenger in the case of checked baggage.</p><p>●  	For DOMESTIC flights, you agree that Carrier’s liability for lost or damaged baggage is limited to $1,250 per passenger total.</p><p>Checked baggage must have the passenger&#x27;s name and personal identification affixed to it. Passengers may not include in their baggage, items that are likely to endanger the aircraft or persons or property on board the aircraft, including those listed below under Section 6 Dangerous and Prohibited Items.</p><p>Each passenger is solely responsible for packing their luggage in such a way that the contents cannot be damaged. Passengers are liable for any damage caused to the aircraft’s equipment or another passenger’s luggage caused by such passenger’s baggage or its contents. Carrier assumes no liability for fragile valuables or perishable articles. Carrier is not liable for pre-existing damage (including minor cuts, scratches, and broken zippers as a result of over packing) or for wear and tear resulting from ordinary handling of baggage.</p><p>Carrier may refuse to carry as baggage any item that it considers unsuitable for carriage because of its size, shape, weight, content, character, or for safety or operational reasons, or the comfort of other passengers.</p><p><u>Notice of Claims</u></p><p>Carrier is not liable for any loss, damage, or delay in the delivery of baggage arising out of or in connection with transportation of, delay, or failure to transport any baggage unless notice of a claim is presented to the Carrier office within 24 hours after the alleged occurrence of the events causing the claim. Any notification received within 24 hours that informs Carrier of the nature of the claim will suffice, and Carrier may deny any claim not presented within 24 hours of the alleged occurrence. If a passenger wishes to file a claim or an action regarding delay of checked baggage, he or she must notify Carrier, in writing, within 21 days after occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. Every such notification must be made in writing by sending email to Aero’s Concierge team at concierge@aero.com. Failure to give notice within these time limits will not bar the claim if the passenger establishes to the satisfaction of the Carrier that he/she was unable to give such notice.</p><p>For domestic transportation, legal action on any claim described above must be brought within one (1) year of Carrier’s written denial, in whole or part, of the claim.</p></div></div></div><div class="FeatureDescription_container__ksXpW"><div class="FeatureDescription_title-container__WITfP"><div color="darkPrimary" class="sc-f22b6d8a-0 gyaJWu"> 4.

If a passenger is unwilling to comply with such request, Carrier may refuse to carry such passenger and his/her baggage.</p><p>If required, a passenger will attend inspection of his/her baggage, checked or unchecked, by customs or other Government officials. Carrier is not liable to any passenger for any loss or damage suffered by such passenger in the course of such inspection or through passenger’s failure to comply with this requirement. Passengers must submit to any security checks by Governments, airport officials or by Carrier.</p></div></div></div><div class="FeatureDescription_container__ksXpW"><div class="FeatureDescription_title-container__WITfP"><div color="darkPrimary" class="sc-f22b6d8a-0 gyaJWu">6.

Accordingly, Carrier will not refuse to provide transportation to, or discriminate against, a disabled individual, who may be transported in accordance with Carrier’s FAA-approved operating procedures, on the basis of his or her disability. Carrier may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger whose carriage may impair the safety of the flight in accordance with the provisions of these Conditions of Carriage, and may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger whose carriage would violate federal regulations (including FAA and TSA regulations) or the Carrier’s FAA-issued operating manuals. In exercising this authority, however, Carrier personnel will not discriminate against any disabled individual solely on the basis of his or her disability.</p><p>Advance reservations and early check-in are recommended, although not required, to ensure time to coordinate the collaboration needed for the safe boarding of qualified individuals with a disability and any assistive devices.</p><p>Although the small size of many of our aircraft may limit some of our flexibility (e.g. the inability to fit non-collapsible electric wheelchairs on the aircraft), we will accommodate passengers’ special needs to the greatest extent possible, with dignity and respect, and in compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation Part 382. We encourage passengers with special needs to speak with a Concierge at concierge@aero.com prior to booking so that we may offer appropriate guidance and support for your travel.</p><p>Passengers who, because of age, mental or physical condition, disability or impairment, require individual attention or consideration to enplane or deplane an aircraft or to manage oneself during the flight in normal operations or emergency conditions, will be afforded reasonable assistance by Carrier employees. This assistance will be in a dignified, safe, professional and courteous manner and at all times Carrier will consult with the passenger about any assistance and special plans arranged on the passengers behalf. Carrier will extend this assistance to all qualified individuals with a disability. This assistance may include, depending upon the limitations of the aircraft and ramp/dock, steadying a passenger or providing a helping hand as the passenger ascends or descends the step(s), assistance in getting to or from the seat, and assistance with loading and retrieving personal items or assistive devices stowed on board. Employees are not permitted, however, to lift or carry passengers on board the aircraft or assist with medical services. Should assistance beyond these measures be necessary, please refer below to the section discussing Safety Assistants. As the safest seating arrangement for passengers needing additional support may vary with the situation and with the aircraft type, Carrier may offer to pre-board the passenger or may suggest boarding the passenger last for access to the most accessible seat.</p><p>Passengers must be physically able to ascend/descend several steps with minimal assistance to access Carrier’s aircraft. Passengers who are unable to board by way of walking up the stairs into the aircraft must advise the Carrier at least forty-eight (48) hours before the scheduled departure of their need for assistance in this regard.</p><p>Physical limitations of the aircraft preclude the use of assistive devices typically available for access to larger aircraft, such as jet bridges, lifts, or boarding chairs.</p><p>Qualified Individuals with a Disability and Safety Assistants.</p><p><b>Safety Assistants.</b> Passengers who need additional support may travel with a safety assistant who is able to provide the extra assistance required for the passenger’s safety.

Carrier will not require any individual covered by this section to be accompanied by a safety assistant unless it is determined that such assistant is <b>essential</b> for safety. Carrier may require a passenger meeting any of the following criteria to travel with a safety assistant as a condition of being provided air transportation in the interest of the passenger’s essential safety needs. In these circumstances, and if contrary to the individual’s self-assessment that he or she is capable of traveling independently, Carrier will not charge for the transportation of the safety assistant:</p><ul><li><p>A person who, because of a mental disability, is unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from Carrier personnel, including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 135.117(b) or any briefing required by a foreign government.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A person with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her evacuation of the aircraft; or</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A person who has both severe hearing and severe vision impairments if the person cannot establish some means of communication with Carrier personnel adequate to permit the transmission of the required safety briefing.</p></li></ul><p>If because there is not a seat available on a flight for a safety assistant whom Carrier has determined to be necessary, the individual will be eligible for denied boarding compensation.

On the ERJ-135, pet carriers are not allowed on aircraft seats, unless a seat has been purchased for the pet.</p><p><b>Is there a separate charge for pets?</b></p><p>Yes.  An extra seat must be purchased (at the currently available fare) for dogs weighing more than 20 lbs.  For a pet traveling in a carrier, a charge of $300 will be applied to the booking.

Failure to ensure that all proper steps have been taken and documentation provided may result in the passenger’s animal being placed in quarantine on arrival. Any costs related to the care of the passenger’s animal in quarantine, issued fines, and any fee associated with returning the animal to its origin will be the passenger’s responsibility.</p><p>Carrier assumes no liability for pet travelers, and in the event of any losses, sickness or injury, the passenger is fully responsible, including any reimbursements.</p><p>All pets must be domesticated, well-behaved and not aggressive toward humans or other dogs or cats.

They must remain on the floor throughout the flight and must never be in or blocking the aisle. If the animal is too large to fit under the seat or at the passenger’s feet, we will accommodate the service animal in another location near the passenger if space is available (e.g., because the flight is not full). If there is no additional space, we will, at no charge, allow the passenger to book on another flight with available space. Passengers may wish to purchase a second seat to ensure that there is sufficient space on the flight for the animal to safely and comfortably fly.</p><p>Passengers can book a service animal on the Aero website or by contacting concierge@aero.com. Should a passenger have two service animals, we will make every effort to accommodate. If the animal does not meet the qualifications to travel as a trained service animal, it may be eligible to travel under our general pet requirements assuming available capacity (see Section 9 Traveling with Pets). The animal must be trained to behave in a public setting and must remain in control of the handler at all times. Any threatening or disruptive behavior may result in denying travel to the service animal and passenger.</p><p>Please note that on our Legacy 600, we have a limit of five total service animals due to space requirements.</p><p>Passengers with service animals will not be seated in emergency exit rows. Service animals may not obstruct an aisle or other area that must remain unobstructed in order to facilitate an emergency evacuation.</p><p>Passengers assume full responsibility for the conduct of his or her accompanying service animal.
